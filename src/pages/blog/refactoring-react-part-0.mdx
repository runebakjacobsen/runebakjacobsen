This series is going to be about refactoring an existing React project. The motivation for this comes from that I am a Software Engineering student at Aalborg University, and every semester we have to do a software project. And every single time we end up with a codebase that I am not proud of and do not want to showcase. However, this changes now ðŸ˜Ž.

## About the project
Last semester we made a fictional marketplace for coffee vendors. This was made with a custom backend in C# with a REST API and a frontend in React. I like working in React, so this is the part I want to refactor.

The project is already using hooks and no state management libraries, only React Context. 

There is not written any tests.

The project use [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling. Recently I tried out [styled components](https://styled-components.com/) and I have to say that I really enjoy using this. I think it plays really well with React and creates very nice seperation of styles and components. So I might be refactoring the project to using styled components, however I am not completely set on this yet. 

## The process

I am going to refactor every component in this project, and I want to try to make it as simple as possible since simple is easy to understand ðŸ¤“. However, I also want to convert the project to TypeScript, since I have heard/read a lot of good things about it, and I think this is a great learning experience.
Additionally I also want to add test to the project. When refactoring a component I will first write the tests for it, and then refactor it.  

Stay tuned!
