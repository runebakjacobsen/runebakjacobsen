biggest hurdle -- making prop types and types play evenly. took some time. Props types are not as important with typescript, but i wanted to see how the project would benefit using both 

the existing hooks in react. I had a use ref. i have it type HTMLElement, but because it was a Div it needed HTMLDivElement

Generics are great and easy (when you have c# experience)
-- show generic fetch hook
