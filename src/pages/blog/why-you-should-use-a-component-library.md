When starting a new frontend project you need to make many decisions. One of these are whether to build your components and styles yourself or to use an existing component library out there. There exists many good options today, such as FluentUI, ChakraUI etc. When making this decision there is a lot of thinks you need to consider. I'll go through some of them here and give my take on when you should choose what. 



## Accessibility

If you choose to build your component library yourself, this is a mayor hurdle you need to consider every time you create a new component. If you have ever heard about web accessibility you can check it out [here](https://webaim.org/intro/). It is in my opinion super important, since we should not exclude any people from the web. 

pros

\- accessibility 

\- internalization

\- thorughtly tested

cons 

\- size 



Large project, limited time, component library. 

still learning -- build it yourself.
