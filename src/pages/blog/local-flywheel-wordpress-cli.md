I have a few clients that use wordpress, which means that i need to work on local copies of wordpress once in a while.

i think have tried every option out there.  Either they are too slow, can't handle multiple sites or requires to much setup. Except Local. With no compromises this is the best option out there. 

However one thing i have been messing forever is the ability to start a site using my terminal.
