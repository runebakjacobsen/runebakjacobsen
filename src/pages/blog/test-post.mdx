# Paying back some technical debt

This series is going to be about paying back some technical debt.

I am a Software Engineering student at Aalborg University, and every semester we have to do a software project. And *every single time* we end up with a code base that **I** am not proud of and do not want to showcase and a product of my doing. 

And that is why I am doing this series! We just handed in the project last month and now I want to make the code base great.
